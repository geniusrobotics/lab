Lab repository for experimenting and learning about Git. No real code here.

(JPG) I've set up this repository as a place to play around with Git.  Don't put
anything here that's really important. Although Git does a great job of letting you
get back to old stuff, this is a safe place to mess around without worrying about
messing up the team's real projects.  So everybody can clone this repo, add their
own files, push them back up to the team repo, etc.
